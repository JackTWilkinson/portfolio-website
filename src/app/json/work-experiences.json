    "description": "At Principal Financial Group, I played a key role in modernizing essential user-facing webpages by migrating them to React. This initiative not only improved the user experience but also significantly reduced technical debt and enhanced long-term maintainability. I also led research and system design initiatives within Salesforce to tackle complex, open-ended business challenges. Most notably I streamlined and automated workflows for contract sales cases. Additionally, I developed a scalable data-processing system using AWS Lambda and Python, which now powers Principalâ€™s Qualified Student Loan Payment Match Program. This solution ensures efficient, reliable, and secure data handling at scale.",
